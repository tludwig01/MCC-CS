My program begins with the hello() function. It welcomes the player to the game PIG, briefly explains the rules of play, then asks a prompt. If they're ready, the game executes. If they decide they're not prepared, the program calls them a "coward" and ends. It doesn't even thank them for playing.

When the user enter's "Y" at the readiness prompt in hello(), the conditional statement then executes the main() function.

Once main() is initiated, the first function called within main() is the check_winner() function. This function does two things:

1) It checks and declares if the game is over (if either human or computer is crossed the 100 point threshold).

2) If the game is not over, it displays the running total score for each side before either player's turn.
